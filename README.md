# PHP Mini Accounting API

A minimal accounting API project implemented in vanilla PHP.

This project focuses on adhering to strong **Separation of Concerns** principles by utilizing the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture augmented with the **Service/Repository** pattern.

This structure is designed to enhance code readability, maintainability, and testability by mitigating "Fat Model" and "Fat Controller" anti-patterns.
